excerpt: A 1 hr. talk I gave about the field of QGMs: 2009-2019
title: Quantum Gas Microscopy
---
I gave a 1-hour talk about Quantum Gas Microscopy at a CM/AMO journal club last month, and it was filled with stupid jokes and memes like all of my presentations. I went through the history of single-atom+single-lattice-site observation in cold atom systems, and then went into detail on the antiferromagnetism results from the Bloch group. Below I've linked the presentation and a latex document with all the citations I looked at to make the talk.
