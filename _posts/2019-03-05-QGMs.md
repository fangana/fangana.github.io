title: Quantum Gas Microscopy
excerpt: A 1 hr. talk I gave about the field of QGMs
---
I gave a 1-hour talk about Quantum Gas Microscopy at a CM/AMO journal club last month, and it was filled with stupid jokes and memes like all of my presentations. I went through the history of single-atom+single-lattice-site observation in cold atom systems, and then described in detail some 2018 results on antiferromagnetism from the Bloch group. Below I've linked the presentation and a latex document with all the citations I looked at to make the talk.

This talk was aimed at physicists with some background/interest in condensed matter (CM) and atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, but to exercise my writing a little, I'll try to give a short version here aimed for people with a general science background (B.S. in STEM field?).
