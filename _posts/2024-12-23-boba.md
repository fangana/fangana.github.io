Annual work update...

I can't say anything about this, or all the other stuff I did this year. But some stuff I was working on at Quantinuum got published too: [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00756).

My family and I went to Taiwan in March, and it was great! Though... I didn't drink as much boba as I would've liked, since we spent most of the time outside the big cities. So after I came back, I overcompensated and made a boba tier list out of it.

Some notes:

* Hey Tea (TBD tier) is probably A or S tier but I haven't had the milk tea to compare.
* I left off some places I went to once in Taiwan: Chun Shui Tang, 50Lan, Truedan, Milksha, and Macu. Milksha was probably the best (A) and Macu the worst (D), but with only one visit I don't think it's fair to judge them.
* Not ranking a lot of one-off local boba shops cause they're usually not nearly as good as the chains.

More deets:
* **Chicha San Chen (S)**: They brew tea using an espresso machine and it works! Dong Ding Oolong or Green Tea with Cream are amazing, other stuff is okay to bad
* **Odd One Out (S)**: Icy Peak Milk Tea (Dong Ding) is just barely worse than Chicha's. Interesting toppings
* **Prince Tea House (S)**: Fancy high tea-like place in NY. Only went once

* **Brian Black Tea (A)**: Specializes in black teas, really like Era or Retro Milk Tea
* **Xing Fu Tang (A)**: Stir-fried boba in sugar in a wok. Tea is okay but boba is good (sweet)
* **Wow Tea Drink (A)**: Cupertino store that's Chicha lite, also with teaspesso machines
* **Mr. Sun Tea (A)**: Homemade fruit boba. Also non-alcoholic Heineken + green tea lol

* **Teaspoon (B)**: The grasshopper is really refreshing
* **Half and Half Good Old Time (B)**: Boba priced like it's 1990, and pretty good

* **Boba Ave 8090 (C)**: ![assman](/assets/images/8090.png "Assman")
* **Tiger Sugar (C)**: Big and small boba
* **Kung Fu Tea (C)**: This is my benchmark for boba
* **Latea (C)**: I went here every day for a week at UIUC. Then I drank some moldy tea and it was all over

* **Dingle Berries (D)**: 626 store with edgy drink names and interesting flavors. I used to have their Rosemead location as S tier in 2018 but 8/2024 tasted just super sweet, D tier. I think they closed down in 2024
* **Boba Guys (D)**: This is shit
