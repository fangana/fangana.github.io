title: Working with optics in an AMO lab
excerpt: Something I plan to put in my thesis
tags: [physics]

As the first step to writing my thesis, I've written an appendix documenting the hands-on skill of working with optics in an atomic physics lab.

# [**<center>Optics Tips and Tricks</center>**](/assets/docs/Optics_Tips_and_Tricks.pdf)


## Table of Contents
1. Basic laser safety
2. Aligning a beam to a straight line
3. Aligning a beam on top of another beam
4. Fiber coupling
5. Aligning an acousto-optic modulator
6. Aligning a double pass AOM
7. Aligning a tapered amplifier
8. Cleaning optics
9. Tightening posts

While some of these topics are quite specific to the Gadway lab (TA, tightening posts), most are pretty general... and repetitive. Turns out that aligning a laser beam is always about "near" and "far" points.

Anyway, I hope this benefits someone out there. It would have helped me back in 2014 when Bryce wasn't around to answer my questions.
