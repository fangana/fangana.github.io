Instead of explaining cold atom quantum simulation (my field) every time I make a post, this page gives the basic background and information.

This sounds stupid, but: "Cold atom quantum simulation" has two parts:
1. "Cold atom"
2. "Quantum simulation"

"Cold atoms" refers to the experimental platform, and what people like me actually work with in lab. For example, I take hot Rubidium atoms in a gas form, cool and trap them with laser light, and then apply some more (very specifically tuned) lasers to do experiments.

There's been a lot of



A lot of the techniques used to cool and trap atoms are interesting in and of themselves, because at very low temperatures, 

"Quantum simulation" refers to the studies we perform with cold atoms. The word "quantum" was cool and wack way before people started slapping it on TVs and stuff, and there are lots of quantum phenomena that are poorly explained because it's just too complex to simulate on your normal computer. So some genius (Feynman) decided that instead of using a classical system (computer) to simulate this stuff, you could use a quantum system instead.

Cold atoms are just one platform for quantum simulation
