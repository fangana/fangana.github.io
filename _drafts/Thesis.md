## My Thesis Defense

Last Wednesday, I successfully defended my thesis. The defense was given over Zoom, and it managed to attract a few dozen of my colleagues, friends, and family members. Unfortunately, the timing was such that not everybody was able to see it, so I recorded the entire thing and put it on YouTube:

For my defense, I was tasked with giving a roughly 30-minute talk (longer with questions) about some aspect of my graduate school research. Because Eric and I have conducted [so many studies over the last 6 years]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-08-19-MyWorkX %}), I decided to only talk about my most "recent" first-author work on interacting physics within momentum-space lattices (this is still in prep). I have "recent" in quotes because this data was taken almost two years ago, back when our apparatus was still up and running.

Luckily, I already did all of the hard work in making the talk during my job search earlier in the year, and only had to slightly modify the presentation to give the more general audience something to latch onto. I was really, really lucky to have gone through the job search in January/February (and landed a job at Honeywell!), back before COVID-19 hit the U.S. so hard. If I were even one month late, I don't think I would have have gotten any on-site interviews, and I definitely wouldn't have flown regardless.

## My Thesis Paper

I'll put a link here to my thesis paper once it's online, which should happen with my official graduation in August.

It's over 240 pages long with all the front and back matter included, and that beats Eric's PALTRY 216 pages (hah). Jokes aside, though... I managed to replicate my undergraduate thesis work schedule of procrastinating until right before the deadline and then pounding it out with many days of very poor sleep. Except instead of a week for my undergrad work, my graduate thesis took about a month and a half of constant work, usually done between midnight and 8 AM and powered by the MapleStory soundtrack.

But despite my constant complaints about the workload and the unbelievable pressure of the looming deadline, I found the process very **enjoyable**. In my many months spent thinking about writing, I found the reason in this blog: I've loved writing all along. Below I'll detail my journey with writing, a now invaluable skill which began out of a few nerdy hobbies. This is a story I've been wanting to lay out for years, and I figured this is the best place to do so.

## On Writing

My history with writing began around 2007. I was in high school, and had hated English class for years, to the dismay of my English professor mother. I was terrible with structured writing, and even worse at analyzing books and texts for overarching themes. When I wrote a paper, it was with great force and effort that I managed to squeeze out a single word, and I called it quits in 2008 after a few torturous weeks of AP English.

### MapleStory Forum Guides

But back in 2007, I was also heavily invested in the wonderful MMORPG MapleStory, with its vibrant and active community. In late 2007, I made an account on a fansite forum and pumped out three popular guides on the forum, each longer than the last. I recently went back to look at these guides (which will hopefully never see the light of day due to excessive 2000s internet humor and 1337speak), and found that they were 5000, 11000, and 20000 words long (overestimated figures). These guides were so long that I had to post them in multiple chunks to get past the character limit per forum post, which meant that I needed to write these beforehand and then spam posts so that nobody could sneak a post in the middle of my guide. These word counts don't even factor in the time I spent formatting the text, editing and embedding pictures and videos, and referencing many other guides and pieces of content.

The entire process of writing a guide like this is, in retrospect, almost identical to writing a research paper. Instead of referencing arXiv papers, I was referencing older guides. And instead of meticulously editing vector graphics images in Adobe Illustrator, I was editing bitmap images in MS Paint and uploading them to Photobucket. At one point, I even wanted *PEER REVIEW* of guides, and was willing to give up my time to become the curator (editor) of a collection (journal) of high quality guides, as there were a LOT of low quality guides floating around the internet with a lot of wrong information. Unfortunately, I couldn't find enough support for such a huge endeavor so I dropped the idea.

In writing these guides and participating in the community, I had unwittingly entered the world of research. While I wasn't an expert at the game itself, I found my niche and put in a significant amount of time and effort into preparing my guides, and it showed in the praise and readership that I received.

### Anime Blogging

After I lost interest in MapleStory in late 2008, I went on to become completely enthralled with Japanese anime. My free (and not free) time became binge sessions of hours upon hours of anime series, and I quickly wanted to share my own opinions with others. I decided to set up a blog on Wordpress, initially under my real name, but later I decided that was a dumb idea and rebranded. At its peak in 2010-2011, my blog received over 100,000 cumulative pageviews across hundreds of blog posts before I (shamefully) deleted it in some sort of self-reflection induced by starting college. While I've made smaller attempts at anime blogging since then, I've never invested quite as much time as back then. But maybe I got out at the right time, as with the rise of (less personable) social media platforms like reddit and discord, anime blogging ("aniblogging") has become a dead artform. Luckily, physics blogging is still around!

Anime blogging had (still has??) two main types of blog posts: "Episodics" and "Editorials". For an episodic post, you would write about a single anime episode usually as it aired each week, and for an editorial you would write about some broader topic. Many blogs tackled one or the other, and there was this split where the successful purely-episodic blogs had their own dedicated (huge) readerships while the successful purely-editorial blogs were seen as artsy and were run by more social members of the community.

I tackled both sides with equal vigor, but I was absolutely horrible with episodic posts. I tried for many years, but I just couldn't bring myself to write about every single episode of a show. It seemed less like a fun hobby and more like a job with constant deadlines. Even worse was the standard "format" of these episodics, pioneered by the popular episodic blogs: a few screenshots of the show, a summary of the plot, and a bit of commentary and opinion. I just couldn't conform to such a rigid and boring framework, and always wanted to go in-depth about some stupid little aspect, or just give up entirely.

I described my style as "stream-of-consciousness", as I would write whatever would come to mind and rarely went back to edit what I wrote. In rebellion against the usual approach of consistency (episodics and/or editorials), I experimented with different styles of posts, sometimes writing thousands of words in a standard "editorial" about some trope, and other times posting just a few pictures or words. Sometimes I would write standard analysis and commentary, and other times I would write satire. I would write about anime series, but I would often also write "meta" posts about blogging itself, often satirical. I vividly remember when the community decided to hold a popularity contest to determine the most popular anime blog, and I was pitted against one of the top seeded blogs (who eventually got runner-up in the 96-blog tournament). While most of the blogs put out a relatively low-effort post saying "here's the voting link - please vote for me!", I went all out to put on a show. I put out the obligatory low-effort post, and then played off of it by putting out a satirical piece on how to lose the tournament. Then on voting day, I threw the competition by changing the name and style of my blog to match my opponent's blog, and subsequently lost by a landslide (88 votes to 290).

Through all of this sense and nonsense, I explored a vast variety of writing topics, developing my writing chops and learning how to express myself through words. Feedback through readers' comments was surprisingly helpful, as I quickly learned what people liked to read and what was considered too much or too little. In total, over around ten years of on/off anime blogging, I wrote almost 200,000 words over nearly 400 posts ranging from 1 word to 4000 words each.

### Writing Term Papers

In 2012, I wrote this paper on superfluidity (mostly on helium) as a final paper for my first quantum physics class at Harvey Mudd:

[**<center>Quantum term paper: "Superfluidity"</center>**](/assets/docs/AA_Superfluidity.pdf)

In a total shock to me, my peers and my professor selected this as the best paper in the class, giving me the Rojansky Writing Award which included a full set of the Feynman Lectures. While I had been writing about my hobbies for years at that point, I always considered my writing to be poor from years of horrible experiences in English classes. I had always struggled to write the "perfect" words in each sentence, then the "perfect" sentences in each paragraph, and so on... as that's how I was taught as early as middle school (topic sentence, then 2-3 sentences of whatever, etc.). In writing this paper, I researched all of the content and then used my "stream-of-consciousness" approach that I had developed from blogging to spew the content onto the page: writing down the words in the order that felt and sounded correct to me. This let me avoid the robotic, unnatural tone of the perfectly constructed sentences in favor of a more colloquial, natural voice.

Of course, this is all said in retrospect. After getting this award, I did a lot of introspection and gained confidence in my colloquial approach. It has allowed me to say "this is correct" or "this is good enough" when I write a sentence, worrying less the perfect words to use and focusing more about how each sentence sounds.


### Writing Scientific Papers

Scientific journal papers stand in stark contrast to everything I've written above. They are highly structured, and stuffed with necessary jargon and references.

Writing papers for journals isn't the same as writing term papers. It's so much more structured, and stuffed with jargon and references.

### Writing the Thesis

I am not too proud of my thesis. I started by pasting in the full text of all of my first-author works, and then modified the text and figures to make sense in the context of the full work. This means that the

However, the bulk of my time was spent on writing four chapters: the methods (momentum-space lattices and atomic physics techniques), two unpublished studies (one of which was in the defense talk), and the future works section. These chapters were an absolute joy to write.
