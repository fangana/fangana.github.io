A couple of weeks ago, Alex Ruichao Ma visited and gave a talk about his work with loss, gain, and superconducting qubits.

I had seen the paper before the talk, and got a bit more detail during the talk, but overall I only really understood *what* they did, but not *how*. This is both due to my total unfamiliarity with superconducting qubit systems and my impressively short attention span during talks...

## Questions/Comments

The results here are really cool - who ever thought of just filling a hole? That's wack. And the scheme of combining loss + gain as stabilization is very creative. But it seems really... limited? It seems very useful as a tool to fill up a Mott insulator where there's a fixed particle/site, but how would this work for anything else, like a superfluid?

You also need to fill in from the edge of the lattice, right? I can imagine it would be hard to make a state with no overlap at the edge.

Finally, this is almost definitely a gap in my understanding: how do you preserve a many-body state when you're shoving particles into the system? If you just add a new particle, does it just quickly entangle with the rest of the system?
