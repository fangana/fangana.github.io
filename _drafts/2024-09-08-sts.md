Work update:

Like usual, I can't go into any detail about work but it is once again nice that even as I go more private sector, there are still public facing news opportunities.

But the point of this post isn't work, it's gaming. This year I got back into single-player games, and revisited two of my all-time favorite games: Stardew Valley and Slay the Spire. This time, I accomplished everything in both games.

Stardew Valley is a clearly imperfect game, and I thought that was necessarily true of a 1-player game. After optimizing my farm, growing my relationships with the characters, and rushing through the mines, I felt done with the game. By the time I got to the Ginger Island endgame, I had to skip days to rack up enough cash for the final achievements. It's always exciting to isekai a new game, but the novelty wears off well before the official end at the top of the mountain.

Slay the Spire is an endless climb with no end in sight

# An American dream

It felt stupid to kowtow to and retreat from something that was so insignificant compared to [dying (black)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd) or [dying (asian)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Vicha_Ratanapakdee). But I was out of grad school, where everything was temporary. I saw people around me getting married, buying houses, and settling down. I envisioned myself five, ten years down the line, and I was scared. Would I still be driving the 100 back home in pitch black darkness, trying to find basic Asian groceries in far off places, and flying back "home" to LA only once or twice a year? Would I have built up or found my own community? Would I only be able to feel a sense of belonging in a limited space? And what I feared most - would I [lose a part of myself](https://www.tiktok.com/@laurajpeg/video/6957382882696367366)?

In the mirror, I saw ripples of my parents' much harder journey, coming from China to a daunting foreign land. I spent my childhood following my parents in their decades-long chase for the American dream, moving around the country as they searched for stability and a place to belong. They gained so much, but along the way, lost parts of their family, their culture and even their language. Somehow it felt like I, the product of their dream, started wandering down that same road, and to what end? I already knew where it led.

So, California.

# California

It didn't need to be *California*. I knew and considered many other places that could've made me happy wrt alienation, but each of those still would've come with risk, and I was done compromising. My parents suggested I take small steps to eventually end up in California as they had, but why take small step when big one do trick?

Outside of California, it's in fashion to dunk on California. Apparently it's a crime-ridden gridlocked concrete jungle where the rich rent out closets, and the poor sleep on the streets. Conservative media watchers see it as a hellish shithole, but even some of my most liberal friends didn't see the point of trading low cost of living and minimal traffic for a little more sun. And wouldn't it be scary to have so many earthquakes and fires?

Now I've finally sorted and written out my feelings about the converse (i.e., why not the Midwest?), but to actually say it succinctly the next time I hear that CA slander... maybe instead it's worth just saying what I told my parents. Now when I'm driving home on the freeway and I see the light of the sunset hit the mountains, I feel so happy.
