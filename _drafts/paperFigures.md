title: Bad paper figures
excerpt: A few things that I don't like seeing in figures in papers.
---
When I read a paper, I start with the title/abstract, and then go right to the figures. When I write a paper, I start by making the figures, and fill in the rest of the paper around them. The figures are by far the most important part of any (experimental) paper, and poor layout/presentation can make even strong results look weak.

There are many basic tenets to presenting data in a figure:
* What sort of figure should you use? Scatter plot? Bar graph? Some sort of 2D color plot?
* How many figures should there be?

In this post, I'm going to turn my nose into the air and project my snobby attitude down on some very minor details

## 1. Non-vector graphics
Vector graphics (pdf, eps formats) maintain the resolution of figures at any size, so I can zoom into a figure and see small details. Non-vector graphics figures are very pixelated and gross.

## 2. Huge figures
This happens a lot with simulation and theory papers: figures that have HUGE file sizes lag my screen when I scroll down to look at them. There's no real guidelines to the figure size

I run into huge figures a lot because I make all my figures in Mathematica, which exports some enormous vector graphics files when using functions like ArrayPlot and whatever. For a lot of this data, the plots are already pixelated because I take data at a finite number of points,

## 3. Eyeballing positions of text and pictures
Sometimes I see plots where the

## 4. Color scheme
I always keep
