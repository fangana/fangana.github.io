title: DAMOP 2019&#58; Tweezers are IN

I just got back from the annual big AMO physics conference: DAMOP 2019 (Milwaukee). Like every year I go, I've come back star-struck at the amazing work other groups are doing. At some times it seems like only Boulder, Munich, and CUA (MIT/Harvard) really matter because the results flying out of the groups there never fail to impress.

The hot new things this year, at least in my eyes, are definitely still quantum gas microscopes ([which I gave a presentation on]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-06-QGMs %})) and **optical tweezer arrays**.

I don't think it's coincidence that last year's Nobel prize went to tweezers when tweezers and tweezer arrays have been BLOWING UP in AMO recently.

I missed DAMOP last year, so I probably also missed the progress report on tweezers... so it seemed like

From the now infamous (?) "51 atom quantum simulator" [[arXiv:1707.04344](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04344) \| [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24622)] paper out of Lukin and CUA, the field has come quite a way over just a year or two.



From Kang-Kuen Ni and John Doyle's work with molecules in tweezers [[arXiv:1902.03935](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03935), [arXiv:1902.00497](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00497)] to new and huge 2D and even 3D arrays incorporating DMD potentials,

this field has really taken off. The prospect of individual control over a "lattice" is incredibly appealing, but only over the past year or two have the capabilities become

And since I didn't go to DAMOP last year, I probably missed the hype around

 the 51 atom people were laying low, Ahmed Omran walked up front and gave a talk that just blew me away. Their newest work [[arXiv:1905.05721](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05721)] makes the jump to entangled states of record size, and goes on to demonstrate spatially-separated entanglement. What is going on??
