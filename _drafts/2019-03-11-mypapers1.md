Written at a physics undergrad level.

In the spirit of trying to explain complicated physics nonsense (the point of this site), I'll start with my own work. Over the last few years, me and Eric Meier have written many papers on different models we have simulated with our system: cold atoms in **momentum-space** optical lattices. This is the brainchild of my advisor Bryce Gadway (proposed in a previous work, [arXiv:1601.05818](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05818)), and in this first paper we describe the system and show three simple things we did with it.

Normally people work with cold atoms in **real-space** optical lattices: if you shine a laser at a mirror and hold it steady, the reflected light travels back along the same path and makes a standing wave. If the wavelength is tuned just right (close to some energy difference between energy levels in an atom)
