## Summary [grad level]
By shaking a lattice at half the resonant frequency (two-photon transition), the bands hybridize in such a way that the phase picked up by traveling along quasimomentum is nontrivial, and the resulting lattice is the CREUTZ LADDER!!! From what I can tell, the key advance here is the implementation of **two-photon** shaking (one-photon gives a "normal" 2-leg ladder), but this is built on the (pretty crazy) view of different lattice orbitals (un-hybridized bands) as a synthetic lattice dimension.

This work is heavily based on a proposal by Qi Zhou and his postdoc Shaoliang Zhang ([arXiv:1403.0210](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0210)) and this group's previous work detailing the lattice-orbital-based synthetic dimension ([arXiv:1807.01444](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01444)), both of which I didn't read but definitely should have.

## Comments
I found this paper really hard to get through, because I know very little about lattice shaking (expt technique) and even less about the Creutz ladder (the model they realize).


The only thing I know about lattice shaking is that it hybridizes bands, but not how. The "how" is central to this paper, though, because shaking at a 2-photon transition frequency causes


I found this paper pretty hard to get through, and I didn't really understand how their system maps onto the Creutz ladder. I didn't read their previous paper which introduced the lattice-orbital-based synthetic dimension, and I have really no idea what a Creutz ladder is... except that a referee suggested that we make it with our momentum-space lattice but we realized it would require next-next-next-nearest-neighbor links which are way too hard to address in our setup.

The summary at my level:

Coupled two lattice orbitals (bands) of a 1D lattice by shaking the lattice at a frequency near the energy difference between the bands. The shaking hybridizes the bands, and by moving along (in q) the hybridized ground band an atom can go between the orbitals and pick up a phase. Shaking on resonance gives a normal two-leg ladder, but shaking at half the frequency allows for 2-photon transitions between the orbitals, causing diagonal links in the ladder, doubling the picked up phase, and making a Creutz ladder.

The summary at an undergrad level:

## Questions
1. How does controlling the phase work? I assume that if you go off resonance the phase can change, but don't the orbital/leg energies also change? Or is that already incorporated into the phase... like changing the direction of the torque vector on the Bloch sphere?
3. I don't see how fermions matter to this, but I know it matters. The Pauli matrices in the Hamiltonian are written in the orbital basis {s,p}, and don't act on actual spins... right? Or do orbitals actually mean something other than bands? I'm confused...
