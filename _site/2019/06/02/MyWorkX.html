  <h2>My Work &#35;X&#58; everything else</h2>
  <p>Because I wrote a very long post about <a href="/2019/03/15/MyWork1.html">my first work</a>, here I’ll overcompensate and write a very condensed review of the rest of the work I’ve done. In some sense, this accurately reflects all of the talks I’ve given: half of the time is necessarily devoted to explaining the momentum-space lattice (<strong>MSL</strong>) platform, and the actual experiments get squished into the second half. Of course, this never fails to glaze eyes so I expect this post to do the same.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="quick-momentum-space-lattice-overview">Quick momentum-space lattice overview</h2>

<p>This is the super short version of my more detailed description of momentum-space lattices in <a href="/2019/03/15/MyWork1.html">my previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Our <strong>momentum-space lattices</strong> are just momentum states of atoms, connected by laser fields at appropriate frequencies.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Between me and Father Eric, we’ve performed and written up eight experiments using momentum-space lattices, and have taken data on a few more ideas which probably won’t ever make the crossover to ink on a page. We are prolific not because we have some exceptional talents but because our approach is very versatile: to make a different lattice to study, we just need to generate a different set of frequencies, which takes seconds. So for the most part, the bottleneck in our setup lies in coming up with ideas and analyzing/organizing data rather than setting up the experiment or taking data.</p>

<p>Of course, there are downsides, as I outlined in <a href="/2019/03/15/MyWork1.html">my previous post</a>. When studying lattice systems, properties of the ground state and other eigenstates are pretty important, but we have a hard time accessing this regime - we begin with all of our atoms in one single lattice site (zero momentum). So, many of our measurements are done by just letting the atoms go from this single lattice site</p>
