  <h2>Tweezer gates</h2>
  <p>This semester I decided to erect my own pulpit for delivering my high-effort crappy powerpoint presentations, the UIUC <strong>Q</strong>uantum <strong>I</strong>nformation / <strong>A</strong>tomic <strong>M</strong>olecular and <strong>O</strong>ptical physics Journal Club (<strong>QIAMO</strong>). And who better to sing the first round of lullabies than the founder himself, Alex An? So, I dropped everything I was doing in lab and spent a week crafting my magnum opus:</p>

<h1 id="this-powerpoint"><a href="/assets/other/TweezerGatesJClub.pptx"><strong><center>THIS POWERPOINT.</center></strong></a></h1>

<p>While I didn’t spend as much time on this talk as on <a href="/2019/03/06/QGMs.html">my previous Quantum Gas Microscope presentation</a>, I spent proportionally more time thinking about the talk rather than meticulously moving elements around in the Animation Pane.</p>

<p>Finally, I realized in typing this up that I should include a disclaimer here: Despite the jokes, nothing in this powerpoint is meant to offend (though “Rubidium” really should be mentioned in the text…). I wouldn’t spend all of this effort if the paper itself wasn’t interesting.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-papers">The paper(s)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title</strong>: Parallel implementation of high-fidelity multi-qubit gates with neutral atoms</li>
  <li><strong>Authors</strong>: Harry Levine, …, Mikhail Lukin</li>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06101">arXiv:1908.06101</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the latest work in a long line of success for the tweezer experiment from the Lukin group, a paper-producing machine which I’ve gushed over in my <a href="/2019/06/06/Damop2019.html">DAMOP post from earlier this year</a>. This experiment has gone from “cool” to “astounding”, and now to the edge of viable quantum computing.</p>

<p>Also in this presentation is a related work by Mark Saffman’s group [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06103">arXiv:1908.06103</a>] which was authored by good ol’ Trent (UIUC ‘16)!</p>

<h2 id="the-physics">The physics</h2>

<p>Here I’ll give a fast explanation of what’s going on in this paper. The system is an array of single atoms trapped in optical tweezers, and the interactions between the atoms are mediated via Rydberg excitations.</p>

<p>Breaking that down:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Neutral atoms can be trapped in focused beams of light (optical tweezers) which can hold as little as a single atom each. This is probabilistic, and you can take a picture to see which tweezers have 1 atom vs. no atoms, and rearrange. And the atoms need to be cold enough to get trapped, which usually means cooling to ~microKelvin (?).</li>
  <li>A tweezer <em>array</em> can be made with many laser beams, usually one laser through a diffractive element.</li>
  <li>Rydberg atoms are atoms that are almost ionized, with their valence electron out really far from the nucleus. This prevents nearby atoms from also exciting to a Rydberg state (Rydberg “blockade”).</li>
</ol>

<p>As for the quantum gates part… they choose their qubit to be two internal spin states of the atoms, $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. There is one laser which addresses transitions between these two, and one laser which adds a phase to $|1\rangle$, realizing single-qubit $X$ and $Z$ rotations, respectively.</p>

<p>For multi-qubit gates, they use the Rydberg blockade to great effect. They have a laser which addresses transitions between $|1\rangle$ and the Rydberg state $|r\rangle$. This can be done locally to individual atoms/qubits, but they do everything in this paper with a <em>global</em> Rydberg laser that addresses all qubits simultaneously.</p>

<p>They use this and single-atom addressing to realize controlled phase, CNOT, CCZ, and Toffoli gates, and build entangled Bell states with high fidelity. It’s interesting to note that by making Toffoli or CNOT and Hadamard, they’ve made universal quantum gates which could be used repeatedly to make any quantum circuit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-cz-gate">The CZ gate</h2>

<p>The key physics, I think, is contained in Figure 2 of the paper, which talks about how they make the controlled phase (CZ) gate:</p>
