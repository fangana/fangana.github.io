  <h2>Boba tier list</h2>
  <p>Annual work update…
<img src="/assets/images/work2024_QI.png" alt="boeing" />
I can’t say anything about this, or all the other stuff I did this year. But some stuff I was working on at Quantinuum got published too: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00756">arXiv link</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>My family and I went to Taiwan in March, and it was great! Though… I didn’t drink as much boba as I would’ve liked, since we spent most of the time outside the big cities. So after I came back, I overcompensated and made a boba tier list out of it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/boba_tier_list_dec2024.png" alt="boba" /></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hey Tea (TBD tier) is probably A or S tier but I haven’t had the milk tea to compare.</li>
  <li>I left off some places I went to once in Taiwan: Chun Shui Tang, 50Lan, Truedan, Milksha, and Macu. Milksha was probably the best (A) and Macu the worst (D), but with only one visit I don’t think it’s fair to judge them.</li>
  <li>Not ranking a lot of one-off local boba shops cause they’re usually not nearly as good as the chains.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>More deets:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chicha San Chen (S)</strong>: They brew tea using an espresso machine and it works! Dong Ding Oolong or Green Tea with Cream are amazing, other stuff is okay to bad</li>
  <li><strong>Odd One Out (S)</strong>: Icy Peak Milk Tea (Dong Ding) is just barely worse than Chicha’s. Interesting toppings</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prince Tea House (S)</strong>: Fancy high tea-like place in NY. Only went once</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Brian Black Tea (A)</strong>: Specializes in black teas, really like Era or Retro Milk Tea</li>
  <li><strong>Xing Fu Tang (A)</strong>: Stir-fried boba in sugar in a wok. Tea is okay but boba is good (sweet)</li>
  <li><strong>Wow Tea Drink (A)</strong>: Cupertino store that’s Chicha lite, also with teaspesso machines</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mr. Sun Tea (A)</strong>: Homemade fruit boba. Also non-alcoholic Heineken + green tea lol</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Teaspoon (B)</strong>: The grasshopper is really refreshing</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Half and Half Good Old Time (B)</strong>: Boba priced like it’s 1990, and pretty good</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Boba Ave 8090 (C)</strong>: <img src="/assets/images/8090.png" alt="assman" title="Assman" /></li>
  <li><strong>Tiger Sugar (C)</strong>: Big and small boba</li>
  <li><strong>Kung Fu Tea (C)</strong>: This is my benchmark for boba</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Latea (C)</strong>: I went here every day for a week at UIUC. Then I drank some moldy tea and it was all over</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dingle Berries (D)</strong>: 626 store with edgy drink names and interesting flavors. I used to have their Rosemead location as S tier in 2018 but 8/2024 tasted just super sweet, D tier. I think they closed down in 2024</li>
  <li><strong>Boba Guys (D)</strong>: This is shit</li>
</ul>
