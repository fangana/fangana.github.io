  <h2>Thesis retrospective&#58; On writing</h2>
  <h2 id="my-thesis-defense">My Thesis Defense</h2>

<p>Last Wednesday, I successfully defended my thesis. The defense was given over Zoom, and it managed to attract a few dozen of my colleagues, friends, and family members. Unfortunately, the timing was such that not everybody was able to see it, so I recorded the entire thing and put it on YouTube:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8sBW7nDgJsc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p> </p>

<p>For my defense, I was tasked with giving a roughly 30-minute talk (longer with questions) about some aspect of my graduate school research. Because Eric and I have conducted <a href="/2019/08/19/MyWorkX.html">so many studies over the last 6 years</a>, I decided to only talk about my most “recent” first-author work on interacting physics within momentum-space lattices (this is still in prep). I have “recent” in quotes because this data was taken almost two years ago, back when our apparatus was still up and running.</p>

<p>Luckily, I already did all of the hard work in making the talk during my job search earlier in the year, and only had to slightly modify the presentation to give the more general audience something to latch onto. I was really, really lucky to have gone through the job search in January/February (and landed a job at Honeywell!), back before COVID-19 hit the U.S. so hard. If I were even one month late, I don’t think I would have have gotten any on-site interviews, and I definitely wouldn’t have flown regardless.</p>

<h2 id="my-thesis-paper">My Thesis Paper</h2>

<p>I’ll put a link here to my thesis paper once it’s online, which should happen with my official graduation in August.</p>

<p>It’s over 240 pages long with all the front and back matter included, and that beats Eric’s PALTRY 216 pages (hah). Jokes aside, though… I managed to replicate my undergraduate thesis work schedule of procrastinating until right before the deadline and then pounding it out with many days of very poor sleep. Except instead of a week for my undergrad work, my graduate thesis took about a month and a half of constant work, usually done between midnight and 8 AM and powered by the MapleStory soundtrack.</p>

<p>But despite my constant complaints about the workload and the unbelievable pressure of the looming deadline, I found the process very <strong>enjoyable</strong>. In my many months spent thinking about writing, I found the reason in this blog: I’ve loved writing all along. Below I’ll detail my journey with writing, a now invaluable skill which began out of a few nerdy hobbies. This is a story I’ve been wanting to lay out for years, and I figured this is the best place to do so.</p>

<h2 id="on-writing">On Writing</h2>

<p>My history with writing began around 2007. I was in high school, and had hated English class for years, to the dismay of my English professor mother. I was terrible with structured writing, and even worse at analyzing books and texts for overarching themes. When I wrote a paper, it was with great force and effort that I managed to squeeze out a single word, and I called it quits in 2008 after a few torturous weeks of AP English.</p>

<h3 id="maplestory-forum-guides">MapleStory Forum Guides</h3>

<p>But back in 2007, I was also heavily invested in the wonderful MMORPG MapleStory, with its vibrant and active community. In late 2007, I made an account on a fansite forum and pumped out three popular guides on the forum, each longer than the last. I recently went back to look at these guides (which will hopefully never see the light of day due to excessive 2000s internet humor and 1337speak), and found that they were 5000, 11000, and 20000 words long (overestimated figures). These guides were so long that I had to post them in multiple chunks to get past the character limit per forum post, which meant that I needed to write these beforehand and then spam posts so that nobody could sneak a post in the middle of my guide. These word counts don’t even factor in the time I spent formatting the text, editing and embedding pictures and videos, and referencing many other guides and pieces of content.</p>

<p>The entire process of writing a guide like this is, in retrospect, almost identical to writing a research paper. Instead of referencing arXiv papers, I was referencing older guides. And instead of meticulously editing vector graphics images in Adobe Illustrator, I was editing bitmap images in MS Paint and uploading them to Photobucket. At one point, I even wanted <em>PEER REVIEW</em> of guides, and was willing to give up my time to become the curator (editor) of a collection (journal) of high quality guides, as there were a LOT of low quality guides floating around the internet with a lot of wrong information. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find enough support for such a huge endeavor so I dropped the idea.</p>

<p>In writing these guides and participating in the community, I had unwittingly entered the world of research. While I wasn’t an expert at the game itself, I found my niche and put in a significant amount of time and effort into preparing my guides, and it showed in the praise and readership that I received.</p>

<h3 id="anime-blogging">Anime Blogging</h3>

<p>After I lost interest in MapleStory in late 2008, I went on to become completely enthralled with Japanese anime. My free (and not free) time became binge sessions of hours upon hours of anime series, and I quickly wanted to share my own opinions with others. I decided to set up a blog on Wordpress, initially under my real name, but later I decided that was a dumb idea and rebranded. At its peak in 2010-2011, my blog received over 100,000 cumulative pageviews across hundreds of blog posts before I (shamefully) deleted it in some bout of self-reflection induced by starting college. But maybe I got out at the right time, as with the rise of (less personable) social media platforms like reddit and discord, anime blogging has become a dead artform. Luckily, physics blogging is still around!</p>

<p>Anime blogging had two main types of blog posts: “Episodics” and “Editorials”. For an episodic post, you would write about a single anime episode as it aired each week, and for an editorial you would write about some broader topic. The</p>
