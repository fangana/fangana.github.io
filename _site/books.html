      <p>Here I list fantasy and science fiction book series that I’ve read, as well as short reviews and scores for them. Hopefully this will motivate me to read more.</p>

<h2 id="reading">reading</h2>

<ol>
  <li><em>The Stormlight Archive</em> by Brandon Sanderson – reading 2015- – <strong>4/5</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently reading book 4 (Rhythm of War)</p>

<p>Long and slow without seeming so. The characters are cool and the plot is interesting, but the villains are absolutely terrible. It’s such a strange problem to have… the enemies feel epic and terrifying up until they’re revealed in book 3, and from then on the oppressive feeling of impending doom is suddenly gone. What a waste.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Farseer Trilogy</em> by Robin Hobb, reading 2020- – <strong>4/5</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently on book 2 (Royal Assassin). Book One was a great departure from the usual grand tales of</p>

<h2 id="finished">finished</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Foundation</strong> by Isaac Asimov – read 2020 – <strong>4/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Only the original trilogy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Wheel of Time</strong> by Robert Jordan – read 2018-2020 – <strong>3/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>My first long series at 12 books, this was vanilla fantasy. While I wasn’t a fan of the slow and often predictable plot, I was impressed at how naturally and frequently the characters grew. It was hard to tell from chapter-to-chapter and even book-to-book, but looking back, I think Robert Jordan really accomplished what he set out to do: turn a bunch of small town kids into heroes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistborn</strong> by Brandon Sanderson – read 2014-2015 – <strong>5/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The Final Empire got me back into reading fantasy/sci-fi after many years. Vin skulking around and taking on the Lord Ruler was so vivid and cool. I don’t remember much from the second and third books.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wax and Wayne</strong> (Mistborn 2) by Brandon Sanderson, read 2020 – <strong>2/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The second cour of Mistborn is interesting, but just doesn’t feel important. The story plays with some interesting ideas, but both the world building and the conflicts are a step down from the epic scale of the first trilogy. A little forgettable.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Abhorsen</strong> by Garth Nix – read 2000s</li>
</ul>

<p>Read this in middle school (?) and absolutely loved it. The idea of these powerful yet dangerous bells is such a great image. Haven’t read the two new ones.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</strong> by Douglas Adams – read 2000s – <strong>4/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure if I read And Another Thing, but the original series was imaginative, funny, and memorable. I enjoyed the first three books far more than the later ones where Arthur mucks around destroying and not destroying Earth.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Licanius Trilogy</strong> by James Islington – read 2020 – <strong>3/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first book was fantastic, but it went downhill with too many villains and plotlines. Why didn’t all the bad guys just gang up on the good guys instead of getting picked off one by one? Ending was okay.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Earthseed</strong> by Octavia Butler – read 2020 – <strong>3/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Both books are split into two parts by some horrific event, followed by rebuilding. I’m more a fan of the world building of the first halves, and less a fan of the more convenient, contrived second halves… even though that sort of beats the point of the books.</p>

<h2 id="droppedon-hold">dropped/on hold</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Harry Potter</strong> by J.K. Rowling – read 2000s</li>
</ul>

<p>In middle school, I read halfway through book 4 before quitting. It was just too boring compared to whatever Greek mythology I was reading at the time. Ended up watching a few of the later films, but never went through the full series. Maybe someday.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Red Rising</strong> by Pierce Brown – read 2015-2017 – <strong>3/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first book was great with an element of espionage, but the second book threw that mostly away in favor for a grander scale. It wasn’t bad, but not much of it stuck in my head as I bumbled my way through the third book. Probably not going to come back to this.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Three-Body Problem</strong> by Liu Cixin – read 2018 – <strong>2/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This book tried to marry mystique with “hard science” and ultimately it seemed like a bunch of great buildup for a cop out deus ex machina. Always like reading about the Cultural Revolution, but that’s not enough for me to go on to books 2 and 3.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lightbringer</strong> by Brent Weeks – read 2015 – <strong>4/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I never read past the first book because I was waiting for a sale. I need to get back to this series.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kingkiller Chronicle</strong> by Patrick Rothfuss – read 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s got a great hook and structure with the tavern tale, but ultimately not very memorable. Didn’t end up reading book 2, and I don’t see a point since books 3+ will never come out.</p>

<h2 id="single-books">Single Books</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Martian</strong> by Andy Weir – read 2014 – <strong>3/5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s entertaining and informative, but often tries too hard to be funny and ends up sounding like a know-it-all ass. A Gary Stu.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ready Player One</strong> by Ernest Cline – read 2017 – <strong>2/5</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rendezvous with Rama</strong> by Arthur C. Clarke – read 2015 –</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1Q84</strong> by Haruki Murakami – read 2020 – <strong>2/5</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The audiobook narrator does a surprisingly good job</p>
