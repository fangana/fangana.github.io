## About this site

My main goal here is to write about recent physics developments/papers in my field (cold atoms), in order to...
1. Read more papers
2. Remember the papers I've read
3. Exercise my writing skills

I've always loved writing final papers for science classes, viewing it as distilling an entire field of research into a short, succinct (?) document. In contrast, writing about my own work in papers/journal articles has been much more of a chore because there's just so much jargon/technical overhead that it's hard to both convey and understand the bare bones meaning. Here I'll try to bridge the gap by reading arXiv papers and summarizing the main points at different levels of expertise: general public,

This is inspired by a youtube series by WIRED called ["5 Levels"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCftwRNsjfRo08xYE31tkiyw) which I think is a great concept, but is often terrible in practice for many reasons (general public audience, very broad subjects, little science detail). Hopefully one day I'll write something about this video series because I have many gripes with it, despite it doing some great work for science communication.
