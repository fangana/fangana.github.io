# About this site

This is my personal blog!!

I started it in grad school to write about recent developments/papers in my field, in order to motivate myself to read more papers and exercise my writing skills. But after graduating and entering industry, now I can't really write about my own work or papers related to it. So I'm ditching my grad school dream of being a jargon filter and reverting back to stream-of-conciousness writing about whatever, my lifelong passion and specialty.
